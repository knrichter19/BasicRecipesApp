This android app uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipes based on a list of ingredients supplied.

Todo list:
- Grab api key info
- Better ingredient display
- Fix visual issues (text box going offscreen, text not fitting on items, etc)
- Fix recyclerview initialization - don't remake everything for each search
- Adjust request/processing for grabbing recipes
- Working buttons to get recipe info in new activity
- Error checking + refactoring

Possible todo list:
- List of ingredients to avoid
- Change arraylist implementation of recipe to a separate class
- Save recipes option
