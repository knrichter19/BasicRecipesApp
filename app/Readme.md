This android app uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipes based on a list of ingredients supplied.
People can then open up a summary of the recipe, which gives an overview of the instructions/ingredients and a link to the original recipe page.

Todo list:
- Fix visual issues (text not fitting on items, etc)
  - Change display of ingredients on recyclerview
  - Stop text cutting off in recyclerview
  - Fix decimal rounding
- Error checking for api requests
- More results in recipe search

Possible todo list:
- General refactoring
- List of ingredients to avoid
- Save recipes option
- Fix recyclerview initialization - don't remake everything for each search?
